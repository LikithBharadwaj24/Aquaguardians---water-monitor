## 🧩 Key Components  
1. Sensor Layer  
   Simulated or real-time water flow tracking via IoT or manual entry

2. Analytics Dashboard  
   React.js frontend displaying usage insights, leak alerts, and conservation tips

3. Gamification  
   Leaderboards, badges, and reward points to promote water-saving behaviors
